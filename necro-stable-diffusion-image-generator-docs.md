# Coming soon to the Unity Asset Store

To open the plugin after importing into Unity: **Window -> Necro Stable Diffusion Image Generator**  

## What are all these settings for the image generator?

These fields are required to generate your image(s):  
**Stability AI API Key:** Get your API Key [here](https://beta.dreamstudio.ai/membership?tab=apiKeys)  
**Prompt:** Your image(s) will be generated based on this prompt  

You can also change these fields if you want:  
**Number of Images:** How many images to generate  	
**Height:** Height of each image in pixels    
**Width:** Width of each image in pixels  
**Steps:** More steps gives better quality results but is slower  
**Seed:** Setting a seed makes the results reproducible. It also keeps high-level image properties like composition and color more consistent across a wide variety of other settings.  
**Sampler:** Different samplers give different results [(illustration)](https://external-preview.redd.it/6TcOaPWKlFiV9riDD4sak6UfI_E_tFBKyn65GodoC5A.jpg?auto=webp&s=e25810e0dbfe63857584375d299f8f5cfebb98d8)  
**CFG (Classifier-Free Guidance) Scale:** Higher CFG makes the images follow your prompt more closely
